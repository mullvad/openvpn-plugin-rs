[features]
# Adds `EventType::AuthFailed`. This plugin event is specific to the Mullvad VPN fork of OpenVPN,
# which is useful to anyone who want to detect client authentication failures in an OpenVPN plugin.
# This event will never happen on standard upstream OpenVPN.
# NOTE: This feature is unstable. The event type number may change at any time.
